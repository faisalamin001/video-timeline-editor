# Video Timeline Editor

This is a simple video timeline editor built with React. It allows users to load a video from a URL, play/pause the video, trim it, and visualize the timeline with draggable actions. The cursor moves in sync with the video playback, and tooltips show the start and end times when dragging or resizing actions.

## Features

- **Load Video**: Input a video URL to load the video.
- **Play/Pause**: Play or pause the video and see the cursor move along the timeline in sync.
- **Trim Video**: Select a portion of the video to trim.
- **Timeline Editor**: Visualize the video timeline with draggable actions and see tooltips with start and end times.
